\subsection{Related Work}
There are several other projects in various stages of development that deal with
automatic differentiation and execution of linear maps on GPUs or in other ways. We are
aware of Robert Schenck's current research project on AD, which is work in
progress, on not public. There is also \tt{caddie}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/diku-dk/caddie}},
which is a tool for specifying gradients in a high level language and generating
efficient code in Futhark or other languages. PyTorch is a machine learning library
capable of AD\footnote{\url{https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/autogradqs_tutorial.html}},
which is widely used, notably in Tesla's Autopilot\footnote{\url{https://insideevs.com/news/383390/video-tesla-andrej-karpathy-autopilot-full-self-driving/}},
but which has been shown\cite{histogrammar} experimentally to be 100-400 times slower
than Futhark in histogram benchmarks.
