\section{How to}
\subsection{Requirements}
In order to run, test and develop further, several dependencies are necessary. In arch or arch derived linux, you will probably need the \texttt{cmake} and \texttt{netcdf} packages, not to mention futhark iteself. On another distro, there will be some equivalent packages you will need.

The different packages available for futhark in the arch repositories are all several versions behind, so I would recommend installing a precompiled nightly build from the futhark website itself.

Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clone the github repository.
\item Add the \texttt{input} folder, with its contents, to the \texttt{lpj-guess-22/lpj-guess/example/} directory. This is not tracked in the repository due to its size.
\item Notice that the \texttt{Makefile} is located in \texttt{lpj-guess-22/}.
\item \texttt{Make 0} to typecheck the futhark code files.
\item \texttt{Make 1} to compile the reference implementation.
\item \texttt{Make 2} to run the reference implementation, and thereby generate testfiles for the futhark implementation.
\item \texttt{Make 3} to run the testfiles for the futhark implementation.
\end{enumerate}
