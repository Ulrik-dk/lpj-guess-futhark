\section{Evaluation}
In this section, we will go through three kinds of evaluation we have used. The
first is a simple compiler example, which generates a Futhark program using the
two compilers. The second part is about thorough blackbox correctness testing,
where we go through the different features of our language and test that they
function as we expect. The last part is benchmarking, where we performance-test
and compare the matrix 'path' and the regular symbolic path.
